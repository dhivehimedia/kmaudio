 MP3 files for Kithaabul Muqaddhas app

The Kithaabul Muqaddhas app downloads any audio files you play to a folder in internal memory called **KithaabulMuqaddhasDownloads**. To save space in internal memory, you can move this folder to the SD Card. 

If you would like to download all audio files, download this [kmaudio](https://github.com/dhivehimedia/kmaudio) repository as a zip file, and then copy all MP3 files from the repository's **KithaabulMuqaddhasDownloads** folder to the **KithaabulMuqaddhasDownloads** folder on your mobile device.
