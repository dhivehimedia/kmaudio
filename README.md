 This repository contains the MP3 files for the [Kithaabul Muqaddhas](https://dhivehimediagroup.com/) app.

The [Kithaabul Muqaddhas](https://dhivehimediagroup.com/) app downloads any audio files you play to a folder in internal memory called **KithaabulMuqaddhasDownloads**. To save space in internal memory, you can move this folder to the SD Card. 

If you would like to download all audio files, [download this **kmaudio** repository as a zip file](https://github.com/dhivehimedia/kmaudio/archive/master.zip), and then copy all MP3 files from the repository's **KithaabulMuqaddhasDownloads** folder to the **KithaabulMuqaddhasDownloads** folder on your mobile device.

Also in this folder is the full version of the **R2L Calculator** app. It's a functional calculator with the buttons arranged in right-to-left order, but opens as the full Kithaabul Muqaddhas app if the user keys in the number 1965.07 and then presses the Equals button. The same app can be found in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inkeysoftware.calc.div), but that version does not contain any audio or video, as it lacks the app permssions to stream them.
